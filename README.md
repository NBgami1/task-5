Project Title: Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier Analysis 🌳🤖

Overview 🚀
This project explores the training and evaluation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. The workflow includes analyzing overfitting, tuning model parameters, interpreting feature importances, and validating performance through cross-validation.

Steps Performed 🔍
1️⃣ Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized the structure of the tree.
2️⃣ Examined overfitting and controlled tree depth to balance complexity and generalization.
3️⃣ Trained a Random Forest model and compared its accuracy against the Decision Tree model.
4️⃣ Evaluated model performance using cross-validation for robustness and reliability.

Key Findings 📊
✅ Decision Tree classifiers provide clear interpretability but may suffer from overfitting.
